# FrictionPendulum-Prediction

This repository contains some of the data and code appeared in the following paper.

Cilsalar, H. (2021). "Prediction model for base shear increase due to vertical ground shaking in friction pendulum isolated structures"

FP_PredictionMoldelNew.h5 is the deep neural network model.

vrData.txt has the data used for the prepration of the model and training the neural newtrok.

FP_Prediction.py file should be run to get the estimation.
