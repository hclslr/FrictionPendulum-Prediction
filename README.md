This repository contains some of the data and code appeared in the following paper.

Cilsalar, H. (2022). Prediction model for base shear increase due to vertical ground motion in friction pendulum isolated structures. UludaÄŸ University Journal of The Faculty of Engineering, 27 (1) , 175-190 . DOI: 10.17482/uumfd.959868

FP_PredictionMoldelNew.h5 is the deep neural network model.

vrData.txt has the data used for the prepration of the model and training the neural newtrok.

FP_Prediction.py file should be run to get the estimation.

RSN&Scale.txt file have Record Squence Number of ground motions and scale factors

Python 3.8.10 and Tensorflow 2.5.0
